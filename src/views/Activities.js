<a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/"><span className="activity-name">Travel the Puget Sound Ferries</span></a> – 
Along the Seattle waterfront, there are several other docks where you can find water transportation for commuting and for fun. The Washington State Ferry runs ferries from the Colman Dock (Pier 52) and also from Pier 50 just to the south, on the waterfront, to destinations such as Bainbridge Island, Bremerton and Vashon Island, with more connections to other destinations all around Puget Sound. There are street connections to taxis and buses just outside the Colman Dock ferry terminal. The Washington State Ferries to Bainbridge Island and Bremerton take both auto and walk-on passengers, and the Vashon Island ferry is for walk-on passengers only.

<a href="http://www.gonorthwest.com/Washington/seattle/Waterfront/waterfront.htm"><span className="activity-name">Seattle Waterfront </span></a>
- The Seattle Waterfront is a wonderful place to spend the day. Pike Place Market sits just above the waterfront, easily accessible by a set of stairs leading up from the piers. The best way to see the sights and shops on the waterfront is to walk along it! From Pier 70 and the Olympic Sculpture Park on the north end to Pier 46, the northern-most pier of the Port of Seattle. The ferry terminal is located on the south end, at Pier 52. Here you can hop a boat to Bainbridge or Vashon Islands or the Kitsap Peninsula. The ferries are a great way to see Puget Sound and the Seattle skyline, without breaking the bank.
</p>
 
<p>
<a href="http://www.gonorthwest.com/washington/seattle/Fremont/Fremont.htm"><span className="activity-name">Fremont </span></a>
- Seattle's Fremont neighborhood is a bohemian district north of downtown. Be sure to check out the statue of Lenin, the outdoor movie theater, and then take a peek under the Aurora Bridge. Fremont is an eclectic, artsy neighborhood of Seattle located in the north-central section of Washington's largest metropolis. Overlooking Salmon Bay, the small community of Fremont bills itself as "the center of the universe." And at the center it is: Bordered to the east by the Wallingford neighborhood and to the west by the trendy Ballard neighborhood, it commands a central place in Seattle's burgeoning growth.
</p>
 
<p>
<a href="http://www.gonorthwest.com/washington/seattle/Ballard/Ballard.htm"><span className="activity-name">Ballard </span></a>
- Ballard is one of Seattle's oldest neighborhoods and was settled by Danish and Finish immigrants in the mid 1800s. Today, its Scandinavian roots are reflected in its historic landmarks and attractive winding streets. Trendy cafes, neighborhood pubs and unique shops have made Ballard a favorite destination for locals and visitors alike. Stores range from home design shops that focus on "green living" to the latest in chic apparel. Visitors can find a wide range of ethnic restaurants in Ballard, from popular Thai cuisine to upscale dining.
</p>
 
<p>
<a href="http://www.gonorthwest.com/washington/seattle/Capitol_Hill/Capitol_Hill.htm"><span className="activity-name">Capitol Hill </span></a>
- Adjacent to downtown with US I-5 as its western boundary. A good combination of residential streets (with distinctive, turn of the century bungalows and classic apartments), shopping, and nightlife. Home to a diverse population, including a strong gay community. 
</p>
 
<p>
<a href="http://www.gonorthwest.com/washington/seattle/Queen_Anne/Queen_Anne.htm"><span className="activity-name">Queen Anne </span></a>
- Queen Anne is best known for its commanding view of downtown Seattle and its stately 19th-century architecture. Bordering the northern end of Seattle's city center, Queen Anne covers the city's tallest hill, with an elevation of 456 feet. Although the neighborhood is not the tallest point in the city (the Gatewood neighborhood, in West Seattle owns this claim at an elevation of 520 feet), Queen Anne's carefully preserved architecture and sweeping views of the Seattle skyline make it one of the city's more popular residential locations.
</p>
 
<p>
<a href="http://www.gonorthwest.com/washington/seattle/Belltown/Belltown.htm"><span className="activity-name">Belltown </span></a>
- One of the city's hip, youthful neighborhoods at the north end of the downtown area. A mix of jazz, rock venues, restaurants, pool halls, cafes, and unique boutiques and thrift shops. You might notice the area is unusually flat for Seattle. It is situated upon what was once known as Denny Hill, which became more the aptly named Denny Regrade as the result of Herculean leveling efforts.
</p>
 
<p>
<a href="http://www.gonorthwest.com/Washington/seattle/Pioneer_Square/Pioneer_Square.htm"><span className="activity-name">Pioneer Square </span></a>
- Saved from the wrecking ball by popular outcry, Seattle's oldest neighborhood is a 17-square-block National Historic District located in the southwest corner of downtown Seattle. The original buildings burned down in the Great Fire of 1889. Its charming, red-brick buildings have been revived and now hold a great arts, café, shopping and nightlife scene. Historical highlights are the Klondike Gold Rush National Historic Park and the unique Bill Spiedel's Underground Tour. Smith Tower, which overlooks the square, was the tallest building west of the Mississippi when it was completed in 1914.
</p>
 
<p>
<a href="http://www.gonorthwest.com/washington/seattle/University/University.htm"><span className="activity-name">University District </span></a>
- The University District is one of Seattle's oldest communities, boasting tree-lined boulevards and turn-of-the-century mansions. Both exist side-by-side with high-tech development centers and the University of Washington. The District caters to the needs of more than 50,000 students and staff, in addition to a base population of 35,000. Two unique commercial districts, "the Ave" and "the Village," provide residents and visitors with continental shopping, dining and entertainment. 
</p>
 
<p>
<a href="http://www.gonorthwest.com/washington/seattle/Green_Lake/Green_Lake.htm"><span className="activity-name">Greenlake </span></a>
- Green Lake, nestled just north of Downtown Seattle, is a thriving neighborhood, aptly named for the freshwater lake it surrounds. The lake itself is ringed by an often busy jogging/ walking/ in-line skating track, and has boat rentals, and Evans Swimming Pool. Located next to the Woodland Park Zoo. 
</p>
 
<p>
<a href="http://www.gonorthwest.com/Washington/puget/bellevue/bellevue.htm"><span className="activity-name">Bellevue </span></a>
- Established as a farming town more than 130 years ago, Bellevue is now one of the state's richest and most successful cities, and serves as a satellite city to Seattle. Bellevue is best known for the trendy shops, upscale restaurants and distinctive department stores that make up the Bellevue Square and Lincoln Square malls.

<span className="activity-name">Pike Place Market & the Seattle Waterfront </span>
- The area encompassing the Seattle Waterfront and Pike Place Market is probably Seattle’s number one tourist destination. We enjoy walking around Pike Place Market to see the fresh produce and flowers and snack our way through our favorite food spots. 
Here are some suggested highlights:
</p>
 
<p>
The original Starbucks - Contrary to popular belief, this is not the first or original location, but it is the oldest still-operating one, and it does have a retro logo on the sign. It’s one of the only places to try the Pike Place Special Reserve, one of the company’s best-loved beans.
</p>
<p>
The Gum Wall - A brick wall covered in several inches thick of used chewing gum. The tradition began in the 1990's. Fun photo opportunity. 
</p>
<p>
Seattle Aquarium - If you have kids who love aquariums. Along the waterfront.
</p>
<p>
Piroshky Piroshky - Russian savory and sweet pastries
</p>
<p>
Rachel’s Ginger Beer - Ginger beer
</p>
<p>
Pike Place Chowder - Award-winning chowder
</p>
<p>
Beecher’s Handmade Cheese - Local artisan cheese (personal favs: Flagship and No Woman)
</p>
<p>
Ellenos - Greek yogurt
</p>
<p>
Radiator Whiskey - If that’s your drink of choice
</p>
<p>
Matt’s in the Market - Seafood lunch or dinner spot
</p>
<p>
Sushi Kashiba - Shiro Kashiba’s new sushi restaurant in Seattle. For sushi-nerds, Shiro trained under Jiro of Jiro Dreams of Sushi.
</p>
 
<p>
<span className="activity-name">Starbucks Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room</span> -
Seattle is host to the headquarters of Starbucks and the best way to experience that is through the original Starbucks and the Starbucks Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room. The latter is best described as a hip place to experience coffee, from the unroasted bean to the different preparation styles, such as a pour over, Siphon brewed, Clover-brewed, espresso, and more.
</p>
 
<p>

Taylor Shellfish Farms has an oyster bar location right down the street from the Starbucks Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room. Washington is well-known for fresh seafood and you can taste some of the best here, including fresh raw oysters and geoduck sashimi. You can also eat fresh dungeness crab here, although it can be expensive. An Asian grocery store like Lam’s Seafood Market will have cheaper dungeness crab that you can buy home to cook or you can get your fill of dungeness crab (and a great view) at the seafood and brunch buffet at Salty’s on Alki (weekends only). 
Right along the same street as Taylor Shellfish Farms, there is an indoor food and retail market called Melrose Market. Check out the cute shops if you have the time.
</p>
 
<p>
If you’re looking for coffee more local than Starbucks, you can check out Espresso Vivace Roasteria or PNW favorite Stumptown. Here’s a list of Seattle coffee shops that roast their own beans.
</p>
 
<p>
<span className="activity-name">Chihuly Garden and Glass</span> - 
If you’re looking for a museum, Chihuly has beautiful glass art installations by the famous artist, Dale Chihuly. The museum also happens to be right under the Space Needle, so if you really want to check out the views from Seattle’s most famous landmark, you could bundle the two. Although we’ve heard the views are just as nice and cheaper from Smith Tower or Columbia Tower. 
</p>
 
<p>
<span className="activity-name">Parks and Views</span> - 
Instead of the view from the Space Needle, we prefer cityscape views from parks like Kerry Park, Gas Works Park, Hamilton Viewpoint Park, or neighborhoods/areas such as Alki Beach or the Seattle Waterfront.
</p>
 
<p>
<span className="activity-name">Ride A Ferry</span> - 
Riding a ferry in Seattle is an iconic experience. Seattle has a great number of islands that you can visit by ferry, including Vashon, San Juan, Lopez, Orcas, Lummi and more. If you just want a quick ferry ride (approx. 35 mins) with a great view of the Puget Sound and Seattle, we recommend taking the ferry to Bainbridge Island. 
</p>
 
<p>
You can choose to walk or drive onto the ferry in Seattle. After you disembark from the ferry on Bainbridge Island, you will only be several minutes from the town of Winslow, which has the feel of a beach town. If you walk, you will find that the shops, restaurants and parks in Winslow are easily accessible on foot. Driving around the island offers many viewpoints of Puget Sound. You can eat brunch at Streamliner Diner or Cafe Nola, walk around the cute shops in the town and enjoy ice cream at Mora Iced Creamery.
</p>
 
<p>
<span className="activity-name">The Great Outdoors</span> - 
We love the great outdoors in Washington. During the summer, there are multiple locations where you can rent a paddle board, kayak, canoe or electric boat to enjoy the waters and views around Lake Union in Seattle, such as The Center for Wooden Boats, Northwest Outdoor Center or The Electric Boat Co. 
</p>
 
<p>
There are also numerous hikes that you can enjoy. For easier hikes, we recommend Discovery Park Loop Trail, Snoqualmie Falls, Franklin Falls, Poo Poo Point or Rattlesnake Ledge. For harder hikes, we recommend Mount Si or Blanca Lake. There are many options out there! Be sure to look up routes online beforehand to check parking pass requirements and trail conditions.
